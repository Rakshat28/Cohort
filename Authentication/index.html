        This is a page to store the notes of Authentications


        Hashing :
        the input is converted into some gibberish and stored in the DB
        same inputs give same output (hashed output)
        I love Rakshat ===> slkafjcbeof2398y89y42p39;wdiali
        (always)
        and that gibberish can never be converted back to the original input


        Encryption :
        the input is converted to gibberish and the gibberish can be converted back to the input
        using a key

        JWT(Json Web Token):
        it takes a JSON as a input
        it creates a Token (a very long gibberish string)
        whoever has the output can see the input , so it is not protected in any way
        anyone can do convertion of input to output and output to input , but only the Token provider can do verification
        it is sort of a digital signature (just like anyone can see your signature , but only the bank can verify it)
        can be verified using the password

        What is Local Storage?
        inspect>application>local Storage
        every domain has its own local storage and access cross domain local storage is not possible

        local storage is stored in key value pair
